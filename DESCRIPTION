Description: This package allows the estimation of treatment effects for randomized 
    clinical trial data using the trimmed means approach for missing data first 
    introduced by Permutt & Li (2017) <http://doi.org/10.1002/pst.1768>. The 
    methodology handles the missing data problem by ranking unobserved outcomes at 
    the poor end of the distribution and then trimming equal fractions from each 
    treatment arm before calculating treatment effects. The fraction trimmed can be 
    pre-specified by the user, but must exceed the maximum fraction of missing data 
    between the two arms. This trimmed means approach estimates the treatment 
    difference amount the best X% of patients from each arm that remain after 
    trimming.
